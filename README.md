# Artificial Images Generator
This repo contains the software of the Artificial Images Generator (AIG). The AIG was developed to create artificial star images, simulating the star images acquired by CCD cameras. To create the images, the AIG models the star flux distribution as a 2D-Gaussian Distribution. This result is added to a noise image, created based a set of parameters provided to the software, as the CCD operation mode, the star flux and the sky flux. Figure below presents an example of an image created by the AIG

This READ.ME explains step-by-step procedure of the AIG to create the imagens, as well as, it presents a simple execution example.
